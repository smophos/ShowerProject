# USER MANUAL

Most of my controls for the shower interface lies within the rectangle box shown on the front wall of the shower and the side wall.
As per the assumption that the wii balance board bath mat is present, the controls shift to the bottom of the side panel. This is to provide use for when the user is in the bathing position.
Shower Controls

I went for minimalist look and feel for the controls. And icons which are decently sized, so that they can be reached by people of most heights.
This being a touchscreen interface, I assumed that the user has some idea of how to use touchscreen. Simple things such as dragging and touching icons to toggle them are the behaviours I expect the user to already have a clue about.

The main controls are for
Water flow
Bath mode/ Shower mode and shower head selection
Temperature Gauge

The Water Flow

The water flow is controlled by the big “drop” button. By clicking on it, you start the water flow. It glows blue on contact.

Bath mode/Shower mode

There are two buttons that help control this, one for the bath mode and one for the shower mode. Toggling one switches off the other. By default the setting is to the bathtub. This is by design, as if you are standing in the shower you wouldn't want to be blasted with the incorrect temperature setting.
You can choose which mode you want to have your bathroom experience in, and you can change it in the middle of it as well. You switch on the water flow by click on the “drop” button. You can switch between different modes, that is shower and bath by clicking on the toggle buttons. They fill up with blue depending upon which one is selected.
You can also toggle what type of spray you want by clicking on the shower mode button again. You can go through multiple shower heads.
 
Temperature Gauge

The temperature slider is used to select the temperature. The more red the slider the more warm the water is, the more blue the slider the colder the water is’. I have a temperature sensor that gives the current temperature of the water. You can toggle on the temperature value to switch it from centigrade to fahrenheit.

Child Safety Check

If the temperature goes beyond a certain temperature, the child safety icon lights up as red. If the temperature is below and correct for bathing of children. The child icon lights up as blue.  

# Critique for the design

My design focuses on being simple, and not throwing too much information at the new user. I considered having a “touch to start” interface. Except I believed displaying too much text at the user, especially a non english speaking user would be confusing and overcomplicated.
I felt like it would be better to have all the controls already there to make it friendly for the first time user. The first screen holds all the basic controls that we need for having a shower. The icons are large, the idea of hot and cold between two just red and blue.
The temperature being visible to the user and there is not much text except for the temperature gauge. And you can see both centigrade and fahrenheit. The child safety icon, gives an idea that the water might be too hot.
